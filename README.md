# Algorithm &amp; Data Structure in C++

# Introduction

Hello, world. I'm gargerius, a developer who has been studying algorithms and data structures in Java for more than six months. To be honest, Java is not a good language to understand programming and I should have listened to my friend Hegz. I do not recommend it, at all. I, currently, loathe this language and that is the reason why I have decided to study C++ in order to comprehend how a structured programming language works. I'd like to thank Bro Code for educating me numerous things, he is cool people.

It is kind of funny to think of how was prospective towards progamming tweleve months ago, like I thought programming was for genius people. I still recall my friend, Zoma, recommeding me to learn programming. My answer was always, 'No'. That is it. I'd refused for numerous reasons and one of them is, apprehension. Then my friend, Amr El-Safy, who is actually my mentor recommended me to study this idotic language, JavaScript. He just recommmended it, that is it. He didn't mention anything else, and I thought: "What would happen? Let's give it a shot." 

As a consequence, I have discovered the Hello World world. I have never thought that I would love programming that much. In the last tweleve months, I had been learning multitudinous programming concepts. Programmig is something else, people. 


I will be pushing whatever I learn. Over and above that, I will solving LeetCode questions in C++. I have already solved more than fifty questiosn in Java which is not a huge number, but it is a progress. As Freud said, “The only person with whom you have to compare yourself is you in the past.”.
