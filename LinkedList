## Linked List

# Definition

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers.

So, it is important to mention that a linked list is a linear data structure, so it is not stored together, or in a sequence. Each node in a linked list can before stored in a different address in the computer's memory. For this specific reason, we do use pointers in linked lists.

What are pointers? 

Pointers are variables in which stores an address. So, it is like pointing to a specific address of variable. 

As we have mentioned before, a linked list consists of nodes. What is a node? We can consider a node as a object which has two properties which are, 'value' and 'next'.

Value represents the value inside of the node, while the next represents the pointer which directs to the next node. 

To make it more comprehensive, we can visualize a node as an object as we have mentioned before and it has two properties which are, 'value' and 'next'. the Next property has a value which is the next next. So, next is considered to be a pointer which points to the address of the next node. 

In the Linked List section, I have learnt to perform numerous things in the linked list:

a) Creation of a node and Linked List

b) Appending a node

c) Prepending a node

d) Delete first and last node

e) Getting a specific node by its index

d) Setting a new value to a node

e) Inserting a new node at a specific index

f) Reversing a node
