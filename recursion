INTRODUCTION

For me, recursion is my favorite algorithm. Thoralf Albert Skole was a genius for forming such an algorithm, people. However, I view it as the hardest algorithm to understand.]
It takes time to comprehend it, bro. So, keep solve problems. 


Recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.[1][2] Recursion solves such recursive problems by using functions that call themselves from within their own code.

1) Each time, we need to make the problem smaller, in order to end the recursion. Otherwise, it will be looping forever.
2) A base case is a must in order to end the recursion. 

Example

openGiftBox(){

if(isBall) return Ball; (base case)

openGiftBox(); (recursion)

}


Factorial Function:

int factorial (int n) {

if(n == 1) return 1;

return n * factorial(n-1); 
}

// I know it's hard to understand in this example, but believe me. When you check the traversal algorithm, you will fully comprehend how the recursion works. 
The Traversal Algorithm depends on recursion.
